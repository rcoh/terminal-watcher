# terminal-watcher
Monitor your shell scripts scripts from your phone. Terminal watcher helps to monitor long running shell commands like compilation or batch jobs. It works by sending you a push notification on your phone when the command completes.

## Installation
See the relevant [release](https://github.com/rcoh/terminal-watcher/releases). I'm working on making the installation process more painless.

The Android app source is: https://github.com/rcoh/tw-android

## Usage
Once installed, run a command as you normally would be preface it with `tw`. The start, end, and exit status code will be sent to your phone.
